            <h2>IEEE Proposal</h2>
            <p>
                Subject: Proposal to Host IEEE Conference at VIT Bhopal University, Sehore, Madhya Pradesh, India
            </p>
            <p>
                Dear [IEEE Conference Committee],
            </p>
            <p>
                I am writing to express our institution's interest in hosting an IEEE conference in April-2025 at VIT Bhopal University. We believe that our facilities, expertise, and commitment to advancing research and innovation make us an ideal venue for this prestigious event.
            </p>
            <p>
                Proposed Conference Title: International Conference on Computer Vision, IoT and Applications (ICCVIA)
            </p>
            <p>
                Proposed Dates: 24-26 April 2025
            </p>
            <h3>Conference Theme</h3>
            <p>
                We want to organize this conference as one of the biggest events in the field of computer vision and IoT. It gathers thousands of members of the computer vision and IoT communities, such as students, researchers, engineers, entrepreneurs, investors, thought leaders, and visionaries. This is a perfect opportunity to discover the latest ideas and innovations, to connect, recruit, and get inspiration.
            </p>
            <p>
                Secondly, because computer vision and IoT are two fields that have become closely related, we invite people from around the world to attend ICCVIA. It covers various related fields like deep learning, quantum computing, satellite imaging, motion analysis, 3D post-estimation, computer vision in surveillance and security systems, healthcare, agriculture, IoT in smart cities, AI, machine learning, and robotics. The event draws diverse profiles, from academics to business people, fostering collaboration and networking. ICCVIA's influence on computer vision advances and shapes the future of IoT.
